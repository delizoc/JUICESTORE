# JUICESTORE
To be used with mySQL database originally used with MariaDB

1. Within the main project folder navigate to /database/db-connector.js. Ensure all information for creating a pool is correct.
    NOTE: you will need to create a new db named 'juice' in mySQL. copy 'ProjectDDQ.sql' into newly     created 'juice' db. This is a starter database with fake data.
2. Within terminal in main project folder type the command 'npm start'
3. Enjoy! all CRUD functionality should be working. If 404 error, db is no longer connected.
